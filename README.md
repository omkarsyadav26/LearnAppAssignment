Assignment given by LearnApp

This Assignment uses mongodb database provided by LearnApp and have implemented one post call which fetches the data from mongo and displays it to user.

I have used mongo aggregate query to fetch the data from database. so complete processing is happening from database side only and node is just taking request and sending back the response which node gets from mongo directly.
